# HackOn2.0

### Our Problem : 
The fashion industry has a disastrous impact on the environment. In fact, it is the second largest polluter in the world, just after the oil industry. And the environmental damage is increasing as the industry grows. The workers who make our beautiful jeans work under appalling and hideous conditions, and many of those clothes are rejected due to small defects, and ultimately end up in landfills, polluting the environment, And it doesn't even decompose easily and takes long time. 

### Our Dream :
Our team has built an app especially for this need. The concept of thrifting and closet clearance is slowing becoming a part of our lives. It is quite a popular concept in major first world countries, and Depop website to sell their clothes online. 
Our app is an e-commerce platform, but for selling rejected or vintage clothes, as well as re-sell clothes from our closet.
 
Through our app 
- Thrift store owners can upload their items on our app for users to chose from it and buy. 

- Users, like you and me can upload clothes we wish to sell and others browse through the same. 

### Features

Currently in the app, we have following key features :
- Simple and elegant UI
- Users can upload multiple images of their clothes, along with  various other details like size, material etc
- Search through existing closets or create your own closet
- They can search based on categories of clothing and gender
